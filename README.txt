these two scripts create a searchable enum field for unity ui elements.
the searchable popup script is made by "ryan hipple | 05/01/2018".
it's from ryan hipple's searchable enum for unity inspector (https://github.com/roboryantron/UnityEditorJunkie/tree/master/Assets/SearchableEnum).
i wanted a searchable enum but as unity ui element, so i made it utilizing his searchable popup.
